## Summary of Lab ##




### Lab Objectives: ###


## Lab Assignment Specific Items ##





## Methods and Testing ##
### Part 1 - Assemble and test your robot ###
For this part of the lab we began by assembling the robot that we used in lab last week. You can find the schematics and steps to build this robot in Lab 6 on my Github page. We assembled our robot and added the wheels onto the bottom of the main black support board, we were especially careful to make sure the alignment was perfect so the robot would drive straight. After that we then moved into the Arduino IDE software to run our code from Lab 6 to assure the robot would move forwards, backwards, left and right when given the proper input in the serial communications. After assuring the code was still properly working we assembled the battery pack that is in our SparkFun kit and attached it to the belly of the car, assuring that it would not drag the ground when the car would drive.     
Below is an image of what the car should look like upon assembly.
