## Lab Assignment Specific Items ##





## Methods and Testing ##
### Part 1 - Assemble and test your robot ###
For this part of the lab we began by assembling the robot that we used in lab last week. You can find the schematics and steps to build this robot in Lab 6 on my Github page. We assembled our robot and added the wheels onto the bottom of the main black support board, we were especially careful to make sure the alignment was perfect so the robot would drive straight. After that we then moved into the Arduino IDE software to run our code from Lab 6 to assure the robot would move forwards, backwards, left and right when given the proper input in the serial communications. After assuring the code was still properly working we assembled the battery pack that is in our SparkFun kit and attached it to the belly of the car, assuring that it would not drag the ground when the car would drive.     
Below is an image of what the car should look like upon assembly.

### Part 2 - Develop the App ###
We started this part of the lab by creating an account and logging into the App Inventor Web-based tool, you can log into your account using the following link. https://login.appinventor.mit.edu/logout  

We then created a new project after signing in and gave it a despcriptive name that was unique to our group. We then moved into the designer environment and inserted a button to initialise the serial communications when we would connect to the arduino. We then found the Connectivity screen and added a Serial component. Then we found the Blocks section to add the blocks shown below to establish the communications after pressing the serial communications button. Button1 is the name of the button used to establish communications, and Open_Button is the name of the serial connectivity component.

## Results ##


**Part 1**


**1. What is the resolution of this sensing system?**



**2. Try to move your obstacle by a millimeter and determine qualitatively how precise it is.**




**Part 2**


## Discussion Questions ##

**Part 2**

**1. What is the minimum speed number for the motors to move forward?**
